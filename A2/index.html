            <p>What is Street Workout?</p>
            <p>It is another sense of Calisthenics</p>
            <p>Calisthenics, also known as street workout, is a form of exercise that focuses on using bodyweight movements to build strength,
                endurance, flexibility, and overall fitness. It is a discipline that originated from the physical training methods of ancient Greece and Rome, 
                where soldiers and athletes would train using their own body weight as resistance. </p>
            <p>In a typical calisthenics routine, exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, squats, lunges, planks, dips, and handstands are performed.
                As individuals progress in their training, they can advance to more challenging movements like muscle-ups, planche, front lever, human flag, and handstand push-ups.</p>
            <p>One of the key advantages of calisthenics is its ability to develop functional strength.
                By using bodyweight exercises, calisthenics targets the muscles and movements that are most commonly used in everyday activities.
                This results in improved coordination, balance, and body awareness.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, calisthenics promotes a holistic approach to fitness, as it combines elements of strength training, cardio, and mobility work. 
                It challenges the body in various ways, leading to improvements in cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, power, flexibility, and agility.</p>
            <p>Calisthenics is not only limited to individual training; it has also evolved into a social activity and a worldwide community. 
                People come together in outdoor parks, urban environments, or specialized calisthenics parks to train, share knowledge, and support each other's progress.
                 These communities often hold competitions and events, showcasing the impressive skills and creativity of calisthenics practitioners.</p>
            <p>Overall, calisthenics or street workout provides a comprehensive and effective means of achieving fitness goals without relying on traditional gym equipment.
                 It is a versatile, accessible, and challenging discipline that promotes functional strength, body control, and overall physical well-being.</p>
